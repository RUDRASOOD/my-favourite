This should add up to around $12,500 per month ($150,000 a year).When Harley was 8 months old, his parents divorced. So, he would spend a week at his mom's place, then a week at his dad's place. His mother lived in Mount Druitt, one of the lowest social economic places in Australia. Meanwhile, Harley's dad was much wealthier, as he owned a lighting company. He first got into games from his stepbrother and would borrow his computer whenever his stepbrother wasn't home. Harley attended private school and was a B student. He would also make money by selling other children items they wanted.[5] Harley has stated that he has an "aggressive stepbrother" and his mother saw that Harley had bruises all over his body so they went to the police station. Around age 13-14, they went to court and Fresh was finally able to move in full time with his mom.Harley Fresh[1] (born: Harley Campbell[2] on March 4, 2002 [age 19][3][4]), better known online as Fresh (formerly mrfreshasian), is an Australian YouTuber, Twitch streamer, and a competitive Fortnite: Battle Royale player.
